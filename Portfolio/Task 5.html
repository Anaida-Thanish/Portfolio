    <h2 class="heading">I Love Photography</h2>
    <p class="manga">Photography is the art of capturing light with a camera, usually via a digital sensor or film, to create an image. The word “photography” comes from the Greek words “photos” meaning “light” and “graphos” meaning “drawing” or “writing.” It is a form of visual communication that has become an integral part of our daily lives.

        Photography is an art form that involves capturing light with a camera to create a visual representation of a moment or scene. This art form has evolved significantly since its inception in the early 19th century and continues to evolve as technology advances.

        <p>One of the defining characteristics of photography is its ability to capture a moment in time. Unlike other art forms such as painting or sculpture, photography allows for a precise and exact representation of a moment. In photojournalism, photographers actively document events and news stories, creating a historical record of unfolding events.

            Another unique aspect of photography is its ability to manipulate light and composition to create a desired effect. Through the use of various camera settings and techniques, such as depth of field and exposure, photographers can create dramatic and expressive images. The use of light can also be used to create a sense of mood or atmosphere in an image, drawing the viewer in and evoking a response.</p>
